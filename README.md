1. the principles that apply to treating physical health problems apply to mental health.
1. TODO: expand this section
#### foundations of mental health
people need certain things in their life to feel ok. when these things are lost or damaged, then mental health deteriorates. the tools in this project are focused on the biggest supports for most people.
1. feeling safe and welcome at multiple places
   - at home
   - at someone else's home nearby
   - at a public place nearby
   - at a place that can be accessed in a day
   - at a place that can be accessed in a couple days
3. feeling that other people care
   - every person needs to know people who consistently know and care how they are doing.
5. feeling that things are fixable
   - every person needs to know there are ways to make things ok.
9. feeling a sense of accomplishment
   - every person needs to feel like they are accomplishing their goals.
#### know these things
- if you think you know someone who might need help, then you know someone who needs help.
- everyone needs help at points in their life.
- helpers are not responsible. do what you can and that is enough.
- helping is hard. thank you for doing it.
#### what to do with a bit of your time
- once a week, ask your person how they are doing. when they say they are fine, ask them to tell you more. when they tell you more, listen and tell them that you are on their side.
- tell your person that they are important to you and you are going to keep connecting with them. schedule a reminder to do it. then do it.
- find someone else who will help you in your helping. we all need to be connected to each other.
#### what to do when you have some time to help
- help your person establish a connection to medical care.
  - schedule an appointment to see their medical provider.
  - write notes about their situation in a shared place they can show their medical provider.
  - remind them of their appointment with their medical provider. offer to take them to their appointment and then out to lunch or coffee afterwards.
  - find out if they went to their appointment. if they did not, go back to the step to schedule an appointment and try again.
- help your person take care of themselves and know that you care about them being well. do a few of these things.
  - go to the grocery store together.
  - clean their house together.
  - go for a walk or exercise together.
  - fix something or work on one of their projects at their house together.
  - do something safe, fun, and easy to do, together.
  - celebrate their accomplishments and your shared accomplishments together.
#### what to do when you are dedicated to helping
- TODO: write this part. getting tired right now... :-)
