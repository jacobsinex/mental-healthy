Pragmatic thoughts to care for your mental health and those around you. I am not a medical professional and this information should not be considered medical advice. If you are looking for medical advice, see a medical professional. 

## Toolbox
Thoughts about mental health and helping others with their mental health.

### Suicide is a Symptom
Suicide is a symptom. This is intentionally first in the list. It is a challenging thought to understand and internalize. 

When a person gets a cold, they might get a runny nose. When a person gets depression/anxiety/other, there is a chance they will commit suicide. There are treatments to reduce symptoms of colds and there are treatments to reduce symptoms of mental health conditions. Treatments can work, sometimes they don't work, but we still try.

Talking about mental health is a skill that can be learned. Thinking about mental health in the same vein as physical health opens the possibility of treatments. Eventually, you might read this section and react with thinking logic instead of only emotion.

Society does not expect cancer patients to deal with cancer or its many devastating effects on their own. We should not expect people with depression to deal with their symptoms, which may include suicidal thoughts, on their own. Accessing professional medical care is crucially important for treating both.

### YANAD (You Are Not A Doctor)
IANAL (I am not a lawyer) and IANAD (I am not a doctor). On the internet, people frequently remind others to seek professional legal and medical services. 

Most people do not expect themselves to be able to treat medical issues of the people around you. If your friend breaks their arm, you might drive them to the emergency department or urgent care, but you're not going to try to fix it.

In the same way, do not try to treat the mental health conditions of people around you. Medical healthcare professionals are good at what they do. Amateurs are not. Instead, learn to identify signs when someone might need professional care. Practice what to say when someone around you needs professional care and, if you are up to it, help them get the care they need.

#### What might they say?
+ I am really overwhelmed.
+ I don't know if I can handle this.
+ I can't handle it anymore.
+ This is all too much.
+ I don't know what to do.
+ I might just go away.
+ I might just run away.

#### What might you say?
+ That sounds hard. Thank you for talking with me. Would you allow me to help you find a medical professional who can provide proper care?

### Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
In any group of people that interacts regularly, whether friends, an activity group, or family, have open discussions regularly about the significance of mental health to you. Normalizing the topic of mental health makes it easier for others to talk about their own mental health around you.

If you are a leader of a group, regularly communicate to the group that mental health is important to your group. Identify a few people who will be mental health ambassadors for your group. These people should take ownership of becoming comfortable talking about mental health with others and without judgement and guiding group members to seek professional mental healthcare.

### Success Leads to Success
People need certain things in their life to feel ok. When these things are lost or damaged, then their mental health can deteriorate. Achieving success in these areas may be helpful.
 
1. Feeling safe and welcome at multiple places
   - at home
   - at someone else's home nearby
   - at a public place nearby
   - at a place that can be accessed in a day
   - at a place that can be accessed in a couple days
2. Feeling that other people care
   - Every person needs to know people who consistently know and care how they are doing.
3. Feeling that things are fixable
   - Every person needs to know there are ways to make things ok.
4. Feeling a sense of accomplishment
   - Every person needs to feel like they are accomplishing goals, no matter how small. Sometimes small goals are more fun to achieve anyway.

### If you have some time to help someone
- Help them establish a connection to medical care.
  - Schedule an appointment to see their medical provider.
  - Write notes about their situation in a safe, easy to find place they can show their medical provider. They may not remember what they wanted to bring up during the stress of being examined.
  - Remind them of their appointment with their medical provider. Perhaps offer to take them to their appointment and then out to lunch or coffee afterwards.
  - Find out if they went to their appointment. If they did not, go back to the step to schedule an appointment and try again.
- Help your person take care of themselves and know that you care about them being well. Perhaps do a few of these things:
  - Go to the grocery store together.
  - Clean their house together.
  - Go for a walk or exercise together.
  - Fix something or work on one of their projects at their house together.
  - Do something safe, fun, and easy to do, together.
  - Celebrate their accomplishments and your shared accomplishments together.

All people that we lost too soon.
